## Code Challenge 01 - Word Values Part I

### Calculate the (language) dictionary word that would have the most value in Scrabble

Read in dictionary.txt (provided, just a copy of /usr/share/dict/words of my Mac) and calculate the word that has the most value in Scrabble based on LETTER_SCORES which is imported from data.py in wordvalue-template.py. 

Make sure you run the test_wordvalue.py to verify your methods are correct. 
It expects (imports) wordvalue.py so make sure you copy wordvalue-template.py to wordvalue.py

Note that no PyPI modules need to be installed, just use stdlib for this. 

Bonus: something to think about: when calculating the max value can you use a fast builtin method? And even so could you improve the performance even further?

Enjoy!

### About PyBites Code Challenges

Read [our intro post](http://pybit.es/codechallenge01.html) or this repo's [README](https://github.com/pybites/challenges) for more info how it works.

Please be patient as we are still learning how to best present the code challenges and collaborate on Github.

We think working towards tests is a good approach (TDD). Also for starters we will be providing stubs (see wordvalue-template.py) to lower the entry-level. However if you have any other ideas or feedback please [let us know](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/issues).

Thanks for trying!
